<br/>

#### Introduction
This paper is about the exception handling & pickling. I will use the knowledge I gathered from the internet and incorporate them into my python script.

#### What is Exception Handling?
##### What is Exception?
An exception is an event,  which  an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.

When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.

##### Handling an Exception
If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible. I chose this site because it has a list of standard exceptions as shown below. (External Reference: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_exceptions.htm).
